		            I was born in Seoul and raised in Hong Kong. I moved to America in 2017 to study Physics at USC. However, due to my love for problem solving and my affinity for numbers, I pivoted to a major in Applied Mathematics. During my summer internship in 2019, I randomly came across some SAS guidebooks. I was fascinated by the ability to generate powerful insights from a few lines of code. This sparked my interest in analytics, and I later added a second major in Data Science. Since then, I have continually pursued analytics by learning visualization tools, database management software, and new programming languages. I hope to extend this excitement towards learning about new industries and career opportunities.

		            My previous internships best describe my diverse skill sets and industry experiences. My first internship was at sQoolink, an education startup in Hong Kong, where I learned the basics of growth hacking. It was exciting working alongside the founder, attending networking events, as well as familiarizing myself with exciting tools such as Mailchimp, Canva, and Excel. The following year, I worked as Research Assistant at Resolution Economics, a litigation consulting firm. During this time, I was first exposed to the corporate work environment and the management hierarchy within the company. I learned an invaluable lesson about communication with managers and maintaining a strong work ethic. My most recent internship was at Haystack Search, a brick and mortar search engine company. My day-to-day involved using SQL to query and update large amounts of product data. Overall, my internship experience outlines a wide range of roles and producing my best work to employers.

		            Outside of school and work, I enjoy staying active and spending quality time with friends. Powerlifting is a hobby that has stuck with me for years and I rigorously track my weights to gain a sense of progression. I like to explore LA through two avenues: hiking and food. I am also a huge fan of Formula 1 and the NBA.

	        		<p><strong>Bank direct marketing analysis.</strong> Utilized chi-square and variance threshold for feature selection. Applied SMOTE to deal with classification imbalance, but recognized it does not necessarily yield the best predictor. Applied Naive-Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree classifier to the dataset. Further applied regularization and dimensionality reduction such as decision tree pruning, ridge regression, and lasso regression. Key metric for this dataset was precision for "yes" term-deposits since the business goal was related to maximizing term-deposits with respect to campaigns.</p>

	        		<p><strong>Predicted stock movement using Stocktwits Text Data.</strong> I organized the StockTwits text data into TF-IDF metrics, moving averages, and polarities. I restructured the dataframe using simple inner joins and adjusted t-day price changes into binary (up or down). I conducted Naive-Bayes and Logistic Regression classification on whether the stock price would go up or down based on term frequencies. High accuracy for training data but extremely overfit as test accuracy was low. Next, I applied ordinary linear regression on the continuous t-day price change. Again, extremely successful training accuracy and R^2, but overfit when it came to test dataset.</p>

This was my first experience with Natural Language Processing. I developed a stronger mathematical understanding of Logistic Regression and the Naive Bayes Classifier. In the future, I plan on using cross validation for future NLP projects as opposed to a simple train-test split.</p>

	        		<p><strong>Classifying abnormal orthopaedic patients.</strong> The Biomedical dataset was provided by the UCI Data Repository. The dataset contained six biomechanical features to classify orthopaedic patients into two classes (normal or abnormal). The primary classifier I used is K-nearest-neighbors and aimed to find the optimum k (# of neighbors) for both the training and test set in order to avoid overfitting. I gained insightful knowledge about metrics of success such as precision, recall, and F-test. I also familiarized myself with different distance measurements such as the Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and Minkowski distance.</p>

Hoping to merge my passion for streetwear and programming, I found this website a joy to make. The tag line is “the ultimate sneaker marketplace” which reflects the overall purpose of the website.</p>
